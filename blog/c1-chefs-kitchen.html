				<p class="para">There is one type of stereotyping that sticks out to me in particular. I was a highly competitive track athlete in high school; one of the best in the state, even. Everyone has heard the saying, “White guys can’t jump.” To me, that is just as absurd as any other stereotype on the planet. <br><br>
I remember one track meet in particular where I was heckled for being the only white person down at the jump pits. Calls of “cracker”, “white boy” and “Whitey can’t jump” didn’t do anything for my self-confidence. No one intervened to stop their hijinks, even though there were at least five adults within earshot. The incident definitely hampered my performance, as my marks were decidedly lower (by about eight inches, which is a LOT when you are jumping over twenty feet in long jump and over forty in triple jump.) It was uncanny how the mere suggestion that I was lesser was enough to actually make me perform inadequately. <br><br>
I can only imagine what some people might feel if they were to face that type of discrimination every day. Not only was it very damaging to my sense of self-worth, it was embarrassing and very plainly wrong. <br><br>
I think there is some merit to the research of expectations on the mindset of individuals. Even if the mindset is somewhat unconscious (which is what is implied by stereotype threats), there seems to be a correlation between perceived success and actual success.
