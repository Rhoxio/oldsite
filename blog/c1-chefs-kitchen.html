				<p class="para">I have been a fairly successful person so far in life. I have always based my actions around what are called the "Cardinal Virtues." These four virtues are as follows: prudence, justice, temperance and courage. Although they have a religious connotation in literature and history, I see them as being distinct from their origins. These virtues are the essence of what great people are and what people should aspire to be. <br><br>

The virtue of prudence is symbolized by a book, mirror, or scroll in most cases. This is the virtue of self reflection as well as knowledge. It is described as the mother of all virtues mainly because without prudence, all judgement would be clouded and knowledge of any kind would be misused. It is also synonymous with the concept of free will, because having the ability to make clear and distinct judgements is one of the greatest burdens of having free will in itself.
<br><br>
Justice ties in to prudence very closely. It is more about having the ability to see and give as you see fit and only taking what you need as opposed to what you always want. This is important to remember when dealing with people especially. If you take more than you give in a relationship with anyone, it becomes imbalanced and tensions rise as a consequence.
<br><br>
Being temperate is as important as being disciplined, namely because they are essentially the same thing. It is about being able to control excess and hold powerful control over your own inner workings. We all have impulses, some of them good and some of them bad, but having the ability to discern between the two while keeping a level head is an important part of making any decision. You want that nice Ferrari? Check your temperance in the moment and ask yourself if it is going to be worth the tradeoff. 
<br><br>
Courage is the final cadrinal virtue, and arugably the most important. Without the drive and want to do anything, we would otherwise do nothing. All action springs from action itself. A very simple way to put it is that you have to actually swing the bat to hit the ball. No matter how many times you want to swing, taking action and doing something is more virtuous than doing nothing at all. This can be arugued against by saying that doing nothing is akin to doing something, but within a similar context, the absolute of nothing is different than a conceptual human nothing. But, that is a philosophical topic for another time.
<br><br>
Long story short, I find that being corageous, prudent, just, and temperate helps me find my way in the world. I make the decision not to remain willfully ignorant and I am always looking for ways to improve. If I feel threatened by stereotypes, I honestly just ignore them. Anyone who interjects that I am greater or lesser because of an irrelevant disposition is automatically wrong. If they explain a basis for something, I am willing to listen, but of their basis is not founded on a life-affirming form of logic or modality of thought, I make the conscious decision not to take it seriously. I think it is as simple as that.
