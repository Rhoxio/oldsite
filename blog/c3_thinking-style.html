		<div class="blogtext">Having a Gregoric thinking style of "Abstract Random" might lead people to believe that someone is an artist or something of that sort. To be honest, being able to see the problem from an angle other than just a step-by-step affirmation like more concrete thinkers do has many advantages. <br><br>

I am often able to see problems where others would not have run in to them until it was too late to adapt to them. I am constantly thinking about results, and my thoughts usually lead me to very basic, yet insightful, conclusions. I think being able to condense and understand coding is very important, but there is a creative aspect to it as well.<br><br>

My greatest hurdle in DBC so far has been coming to terms with my own abilities. I lost a bit of confidence when I first started working on HTML simply because I felt as if I was getting nowhere for a few days. I found that taking frequent breaks and constantly doing research ammended this problem immediately. Sometimes, you just have to sleep on a problem to truly understand the scope of it and come up with a creative, yet simple, answer. <br><br>

I have actually been a social advocate of growth versus fixed mindset for a long time. When people in sports asked me why I was so successful, I usually told them it was simply because I always wanted to grow. The sky is the limit, and the only way you will stay the same is if you allow yourself to. Swinging the bat when you are scared to death can be the best thing that has ever happened to you, but you have to have the courage to try your best when you decide to try something. Sometimes a great thing comes in to your life, and you don't embrace the change it brings along with it. Instead of trying to remain the same, roll with the punches and adapt. You'll learn SO much more that way, and you will always reap rewards from work if you keep the right mindset.<br><br>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p class="am-text">I am, well I used to be, a college student who has always had an insatiable drive to learn about the world. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp to learn how to code and develop pretty much anything that my heart desires. That is all anyone can ever truly strive for, right? <br><br>-The links below are broken for the time being. I am working on updating all of my pages.-</p>
