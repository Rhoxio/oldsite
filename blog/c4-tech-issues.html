		<div class="blogtext">	When I think if a problem in the world of technology, I tend to imagine the infinite possibilities laid out before us as we barrel forward at an exponential rate. Along with this expansion, many more people become acclimated to having and using technology.  Smart phones, iPads and laptops are quintessential in keeping up with an ever-churning mass of information that is the internet. While we have developed great tools that aid in every aspect of our lives, we seem to have missed the fact that we are going to be the generation of people to give the information age it's name in the history books. <br><br>
	
	We see many jobs being flung in to the world of IT and programming. Many of these jobs offer great opportunities for younger people to find their way in life, because let's be honest: the older people need the kids to run their email servers. They need young people who have grown up with technology around them to build websites, write programs, and fix their laser printers when the damn thing won't stop printing. From personal experience, I have dealt with at least three technology issues that were not directly my own doing. Skype wasn't recognizing a webcam, so I updated it. It worked because I Googled the problem. My grandmother needed a music CD burned for her ukelele group. After some banter and a few candies, it easy enough to accomplish. My mom's cell phone wouldn't go on silent. The sound profile was set to outdoor. It is the things that are obvious to us, but hard for them to grasp that make us more useful than Google. My question is, what will happen when everyone is acclimated to technology? 
<br><br>
	Anyone can make a postulation about the state of the world in fifty years. We probably won't be flying around in cars or paying our taxes in bitcoins, but we will definitely have computers that can move data around hundreds of times more efficiently. This is evidenced by the popularity of solid state drives, which allow for much faster data transfer rates than analog drives. The difference in speed itself would change the technology game tremendously. Imagine a $400 laptop that was as fast as a high end desktop now. All of a sudden, everyone has the ability to do their own data processing again instead of using cloud systems. Sure, you can talk all day about heat distribution and cooling costs, but the fact of the matter is that in 50 years, we will probably have vastly improved everything. Even now, liquid cooling is becoming more popular among computer enthusiasts because of the low-cost maintenance it brings. Some people even submerge their computers in mineral oil as a way to keep them cool. 
	<br><br>
	With added ability comes added potential. If we are simply able to plug in to a device and use it second-nature, the ones who produce the software to run these types of things will hold a lot more power than they used to. All of a sudden, you could have a new Microsoft who specializes in programming surrounding solving real-life problems that could not be solved before. Need surgery? Let the robot who can do billions of calculations per second do it. Need to drive to work? Touch a button on your car and have the AI chip linked to your “phone” drive you to work while you make conversation. 
<br><br>
	There are limitless possibilities in both the software and hardware fields of computer technology. We are a ways out from super-storage and virtually infinitely fast processors, but we are far enough along to begin formulating the bases of these future technologies. Every moment we live is the latest moment in time, and as time ticks away, our minds will shape a future with vigor as a new frontier opens up before us.

		Hashes, in essence, are just the opposite. They are values (usually numeric ones) that are assigned to specific pieces of information such as a name or address. You can call the hash and grab, say, someones name. This is important, because people who are dealing with cyber security often use hash values to help keep names secret. It is similar to having a key for a lock. The values on a sheet are assigned to hash values and don't actually display the information itself. It is a reference to the information, much like the index of a book.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p class="am-text">I am, well I used to be, a college student who has always had an insatiable drive to learn about the world. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp to learn how to code and develop pretty much anything that my heart desires. That is all anyone can ever truly strive for, right? <br><br>-The links below are broken for the time being. I am working on updating all of my blog pages.-</p>
