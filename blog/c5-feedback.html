		<div class="blogtext">	With Common Core standards rolling out all across California, one can't help but notice that education has been long overdue for a curriculum makeover. One thing that stuck out to me is the fact that many times the children are asked to pair, just as we have been asked to pair. The children are usually left to grapple with the challenges, and even though a twenty-plus year old person has more developed social and cognitive ability, one can not escape the problems that arise when dealing with people.<br><br>
	 Many people think that speaking to someone they haven't met is a stressful and a generally annoying practice, but if you follow a few rules, it becomes much easier to work with anyone.
	The first rule is to simply smile. Smiling is the easiest way to ease social tension, simply because human intuition is geared toward feeling more comfortable with people who smile more. <br><br>
	The second thing to consider is that many times, people feel insecure because they do not know you. The check-ins that DBC has us do is a direct example of this concept being used beautifully in practice. You establish a base and know a little more about your partner, and that translates to a smoother experience.<br><br>
	The third thing to keep in mind is that most of the time, people are going to focus on their problems over your own. You can help them develop a more trusting partnership with them if you talk less about yourself and more about the problems and/or them. <br><br>
	As for my personal experience with pairing, I have found almost no negative aspect to the open collaboration that it brings to the table. Just this week, Brittney and I traded bits of code pertaining to the pairing session even after the session itself. We weren't satisfied with our refactor, so we set out to fix what we started. After a day or so, we both had inklings of what needed to happen to get our code to look beautiful. After a few emails and some very clever usage of arrays, we had an amazing product that we couldn't have come up with on our own. Not only was pairing rewarding, it was an entertaining and ultimately positive experience. You are able to see different perspectives much more easily than reading about someone else's code. <br><br>
