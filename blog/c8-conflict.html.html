		<div class="blogtext">	One time in particular that sticks out to me is when I had a fight with one
of my best friends, Cooper. We were partners in a game, and we consistently
played off of one another to win our matches. With any competitive thing, 
tempers can flare and quickly grow out of control. Cooper was a very 
straightforward person, and he was grating on my nerves one match in 
particular, and we went off on each other. <br><br>

The conflict arose simply because we had a miscommunication about where to
go on the map at a certain time. We had both been irritated from the match 
before where we got smashed.<br><br>

The conflict itself was resolved when after a few days of not talking, we 
decided to grow up and apologize to each other. I initiated the apology, and
overall my action over his inaction is what resolved the situation. <br><br>

I would have gone back and tried to be more cognizant while playing the game.
By cognizant, I mean more aware of how my partner was feeling as opposed to just how I was feeling at the time. I needed to be more empathetic toward his situation. <br><br>
