		<div class="blogtext">Having the ability to articulate and express your thinking is a developed skill. Anyone will tell you that it takes a lot of time and practice to improve at reading and writing, but the more you do it and more more you are exposed to it, the more fficient your learning becomes. The same concept of progressive improvement applies to asking questions. It is not unreasonable to assume that the action of asking is akin to the action of thinking or doing. In order to understand, you must first have an understanding of the nature of any question. This is where I feel that many people get stuck. I can think of more than a few ways many people can improve upon their inquisitive skillset.<br><br>

First and foremost, the notion that asking questions is bad must be thrown to the wind and never be thought of again. Someone who is wise asks questions when they are not sure of something, but they do not ask without thinking about their topic first. This means that you should always look at your question as if you were going to have to answer it yourself. If you understand what you are saying when you read it out loud to yourself, then chances are that someone on the recieving end of the question will be able to pick up your meaning more easily than if you had simply slapped together a sentence with a bunch of "likes" or "somethings" in it. Articulation and specification are important. If you feel as if you don't have the vocabulary or expertise to describe your problem specifically, then you may need to do more personal research on the topic. There are no bad questions; they are simply underdeveloped.<br><br>

It is also important to attempt to understand the scope of reference of the person whom you are asking the question to. You would not ask a businessman about the culture surrounding African trade unless he had experience with it. This is part of the reason that we use experts in our judicial system when facts are more of a matter of opinion than solidified evidence. Speculation of the educated is often times more enlightening than the speculation of a novice, so choosing who you ask is just as important as wording the question correctly. This is harder to filter on online message boards, but many times reputation systems help establish a heirarchy of expertise. The coin/medal system on Stackoverflow is a prime example of this distinction.<br><br>

For the most part, asking a good question is similar to writing a complete sentence. Make sure you have a topic, a basic description, and a concise syntax that does not leave much open to interpretation (unless you are asking an extremely challenging or philosophical question, that is). This also means that you should possibly make an attempt to map out your thinking to help with clarification. This is very similar to what we have been doing with pseudocode. Sometimes setting something up as a sort of visual aid can not only help express your thinking more completely, but it can help whoever is answering your question more completely understand exactly what you are asking. <br><br>

For the most part, asking a good question is about thinking before you ask. Sometimes asking yourself questions before asking a question is better than asking simply to get an answer. <br>
