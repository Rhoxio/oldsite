				<p class="para">"For the most part, this has been a fairly insightful week. I have been asked to answer a few questions in this first blog, so I will do just that.<br>
  
  
<b>What are the benefits of version control?</b> Version control has many different applications. The one that stands out in my mind is version controls ability to be flexible. If you decide that you needed a more basic version of some block of control code, you can go back in time and pull those pieces of code out and use them for different things. It basically allows you to write specialized code without worrying about messing other pieces up. <br>

<b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b> Git helps you control change by allowing you to "branch" off and make different versions of things very easily. It makes this process easy by making everything extremely easy to figure out as well as displaying pertinent information in logical places on GitHub. <br>


<b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b> GitHub allows you to collaborate much more easily than always sending emails, setting up archives, or simply copy-pasting blocks of code from stackoverflow or some other site. It allows people to be credited as a contributor, which alleviates some of the problems with copyright and licensing, as well as having an extremely efficient and powerful site to back up the entire creative process.
