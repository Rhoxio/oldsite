				<p class="para">Variable scope is an inherently important part of programming with Ruby. The scope of variables allows you to access data outside of simple local variables. You have the ability to set global variables, variables that can be called from anywhere in the program, but this is generally not recommended as it can cause serious problems because that also means that it can be accessed from anywhere in the program as well. It can cause naming issues and make it extremely hard to debug code if they are not used correctly.<br> <br>
A more commonly used type of variable is the instance variable(@). This variable is unique in the fact that it can essentially be used to set a value that can be used throughout a class and other classes. It differs from a class variable (@@) in the fact that a class variable can only be used once inside of that class. For example, if we have two identical classes called Animal and one is labeled Dog and the other Cat, it makes sense to add a class variable @@Labrador to the Dog class, because the Cat class may need one named @@Tabby. On the other hand, you can set a variable called @legs for both and set it equal to 4. It is a way to differentiate certain attributes  within classes.<br><br> 
If you want to have a value that can never change, you should be using a constant. Constants are denoted by hitting your caps lock key, essentially. All of the letters in the variable name need to be capital letters. They differ from global variables in that they cannot be changed once set unless you modify the code manually. 
Overall, the scope of Ruby variables is a fundamental part of object oriented programming. Without it, we would have to set our local variables every time we wanted to write any block of code. Not only would that get old extremely fast, it would decimate the flexibility of code as we know it.
