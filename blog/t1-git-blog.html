				<p class="para">Working with Javascript has been a week of ups and downs. I feel like the base set of programming skills that I acquired while learning Ruby helped tremendously when it came to learning Javascript. The clearest comparison that I can draw between the two is that Javascript is more simple-construction oriented than Ruby. Ruby was more focused on building data structure as where Javascript is more focused on creating objects and actually manipulating the object values. <br><br>

In Ruby, semi-complex objects are created using class structure. In Javascript, they are created simply by naming a variable and it's attributes. In ruby, the methods called within the classes are what gave the class itself attributes. In Javascript, it is more straightforward. You basically just make a variable and give it attributes that you can call to get values. Ruby does the same thing essentially, but it felt more convoluted to make and use small sets of data.<br><br> 

The documentation surrounding both was fairly similar. I enjoyed reading the Javascript stuff more, mainly because it was chock full of examples and little quips of code that you could try out on the spot of you were confused. A lot of the ruby documentation was formatted more clearly, but didn't have the same interactability as the Javascript stuff. <br><br>

Looping in both languages is essentially the same. Javascript requires more symbols to signify breaks and separation in the code, but it is hardly as issue as the syntax is very consistent. Using for loops in Javascript is a nice touch, as the syntax is just about the same as writing a block in Ruby. <br><br>

For the most part, the math seems much less convoluted to do in Javascript while writing and editing text is easier to accomplish in Ruby. Again, that more than likely comes down to Ruby being a language that is used to set up framework as opposed to doing hard calcuations like Python or something. <br><br>
