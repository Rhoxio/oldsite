				<p class="para">Margin, border, and padding are all part of the "box model" that has to do with CSS elements. Margin is the farthest out setting that allows you to get spacing between other elements. Border is the next step in, and is a visible part of the styling. Padding is the space bewteen the actual object and the border. If you add a 1px padding to something, the border will start 1px out. The padding also shows whatever you set the background as.<br></br>

				You have to be wary when working with these, though. Changing the values of anything around can resize your element and make it harder to place correctly. If I really want to make something exactly a certain number of pixels large, I do the margin, border, and padding and then resize the element slightly to compensate for the excess space that they took up. I realize that setting up webpages takes a bit of planning, but it eventually becomes much more intuitive as you practice.
