		<div class="blogtext">Arrays and hashes are two sides of the same coin. Essentially, an array has values that are used to manipulate the output of a certain section of code. You can run a set of values through code using arrays instead of having to input values in to separate sections of code manually or through the usage of other blocks of code. (If this was the case, we would just develop arrays themselves! Luckily, we don't have to because those smart precursors of ours did it for us.)<br><br>

		An example would be something like:
		<code>
		def array1(x,y,z)
			if x == y
				puts "Nice!"
			elsif x == z
				puts "Not nice..."
			end
		end

		array1(1,2,1) # would return "Not nice..."

		array1(1,1,2) # Would return "Nice!"

		(I will make a div for this later. I need to get it all laid out right now.)

		</code><br><br>

		Hashes, in essence, are just the opposite. They are values (usually numeric ones) that are assigned to specific pieces of information such as a name or address. You can call the hash and grab, say, someones name. This is important, because people who are dealing with cyber security often use hash values to help keep names secret. It is similar to having a key for a lock. The values on a sheet are assigned to hash values and don't actually display the information itself. It is a reference to the information, much like the index of a book.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p class="am-text">I am, well I used to be, a college student who has always had an insatiable drive to learn about the world. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp to learn how to code and develop pretty much anything that my heart desires. That is all anyone can ever truly strive for, right? <br><br>-The links below are broken for the time being. I am working on updating all of my blog pages.-</p>
