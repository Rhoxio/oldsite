		<div class="blogtext">	Classes in themselves are fairly simple things. You need a name for your class, an initialize method to set your global variables and do some front-end calculations, and a few body methods, and a nice conditional to see if it evaluates to true or not. <br><br>
	Wait, that sounds familiar. It sounds relatively similar to how you format writing. Who would ever believe that logic manipulation is akin to creating a written work of art? Considering all of the similarities, it surprises me that these parallels have not been drawn in the sand a few thousand times across a few hundred different websites. 
	Wait. It has. One of the beautiful things about ruby is that if you understand the jargon, you can read it almost identically to how you read text. The similarities between methods and sentences in uncanny, and since classes are essentially a bunch of methods pushed together in to one item, it is not much of a stretch to equate them to a short essay. This is one of the reasons that I write out my pseudocode like I am explaining a process to someone. If I can make it easier for a human to understand what needs to happen by translating the essence of what needs to be coded in to writing, all they need to do is think about how they would actually solve the problem and BAM! <br><br>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p class="am-text">I am, well I used to be, a college student who has always had an insatiable drive to learn about the world. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp to learn how to code and develop pretty much anything that my heart desires. That is all anyone can ever truly strive for, right? <br><br>-The links below are broken for the time being. I am working on updating all of my blog pages.-</p>
