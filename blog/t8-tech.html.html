		<div class="blogtext">	There has been a disconnect in pop culture as to the distinction between 
what is commonly refered to as RAM (Random Access Memory) and an actual permamnent form of data storage. In order to understand the distinction, you must know what each does. <br><br>

In essence, RAM is the memory space where data is loaded while the computer is on. Programs that are currently running are put on to the RAM so it may be accessed much faster when it is needed. Normal analog hard discs retrieve data much slower, as they have to spin and read data as it passes by the read-head inside of the drive itself. RAM and flash memory chips can be read much faster, mainly because they do not have moving parts. <br><br>

The recent emergence of solid state drives (essentially huge stocks of flash-drive-like storage) has turned the world of computing data quickly in to more of a convenience. The main advantage to having a SSD is that it loads almost as fast as your processor can pull data from the disc. This means that video editing, 3d modeling, and other hard-drive intensive functions can be done much faster and with less buffering needed. There are faster variants of standard analog drives, but they are just about as expensive as a SSD, but they do not wear out as fast. <br><br>

So, why don't we just use a huge solid state drive instead of RAM? Well, that is mainly because RAM is still faster than a standard 6gb/s SATA cable can handle. RAM runs about three times as fast, actually, and having dedicated memory for programs is simply more convenient than partitioning parts of an expensive SSD when RAM is cheaper and can simpy do the job better. <br><br>

So, where does the distinction lie? Essentually, a standard hard drive can not store and retireve data faster than it can spin. Solid state drives circumvent the moving parts problem, but are hampered by cost and lifespan. RAM is used to hold temporary data because not only is it more efficient, but it is simply designed to do so. <br><br>
